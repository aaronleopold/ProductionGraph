# Contributions

An overview of individual contributions not reflected in the git repo records (commits, pull requests, assigned issues).
Much of our work was tracked by git and Github, and is reflected in the commit history, Projects, closed pull requests, and closed issues. 
However, some of our work is not visible in those places, and is listed here.
